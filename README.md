The application presents a list of students, where each student is characterized by their first name, last name, personal identification number (CNP), faculty, and a list of optional courses they are attending. Each course has a name, an associated number of credits, and a status indicating whether it was passed or not. A list of students is created. In the Student class, there is a method that calculates the total number of credits a student has earned by summing up the credits from the passed exams. From the student list, the female students are identified and displayed based on their CNP or gender. The list of students is sorted in descending order by the number of optional courses they are attending, using the sorting functionality from the Collections class. Then, the students are sorted by their total number of credits in descending order. Finally, a method for validating the CNP is implemented.
